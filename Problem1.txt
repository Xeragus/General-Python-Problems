Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.
Input the sentence from keyboard, after printing an input message. Then put them 
into a dictionary, together with the number of their occurrences in the sentence.
Find all the words that have occurred only once and transform them in upper case.
Then find all the words that have occurred twice, remove them (the keys) and insert new keys
in their position. This key will be a combination of the first two and the last
two letters of the removed word. If the word has less than 2 letters, do not remove it.
