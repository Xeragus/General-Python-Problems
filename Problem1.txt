Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.
Input the sentence from keyboard, after printing an input message.
Find all the words that have occurred only once and transform them in upper case.
Then find all the words that have occurred twice, remove them and insert new word
in their position. This word will be a combination of the first two and the last
two letters of the removed word. If the word has less than 2 letters, do not remove it.
